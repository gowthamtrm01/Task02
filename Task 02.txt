1. Load the rest countries data using your html and script.js file and run a for loop on the data and print all the country name in the console.
   

    
2. Give a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.
   
   When you copy an object b = a both variables will point to the same address.
   This behavior is called copy by reference value. Strictly speaking in Ruby and JavaScript
   everything is copied by value. When it comes to objects though, the values happen to be 
   memory addresses of those objects.

3. How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).
   
   var b= [10,20] // b holds some address like 8023 etc.. not 10 and 20. Therefore we can't clone data in composite data types. 
   To do that spread operator is used, that is three dots (â€¦), it spreads the elements of that particular array or object
   and its values can be used to assign to some other variable.
